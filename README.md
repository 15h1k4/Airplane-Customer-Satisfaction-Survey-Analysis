# Airplane-Customer-Satisfaction-Survey-Analysis

Introduction - Scores of customer satisfaction from more than 120,000 passengers aboard aeroplanes, including details about each passenger, their flight, and the nature of their trip, as well as their assessments of various aspects like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience. I have used Power BI for data modelling and data analysis.

Analysis- On the whole the satisfaction rate is lesser than dissatisfaction rate. Younger and elder age group aren't satisfied with the services catered to them which includes services such as gate-location, in-flight wifi services and Online Booking in which most of them travelled in economy class and 49.07 % are first time flyers for their personal purpose. 

Results- Satisfying first time flyers requirements will help airline company in the longer run as they have shown more dissatisfaction. Economy an Economy Plus should be given immediate attention since the satisfaction level of these passengers are very low. Improving Wifi services and online website/app's User Interface and glitches would increase the satisfaction rate from the age group who are dissapointed.
